what's Algora?
--------------
algora it's a program generate a texted file on desktop with a list of numbers
from the number you want to start accounting by him to the last numbers you want reaching it
and write everynumber in single line


where's the file ?
------------------
the file like already say, you find him on your desktop by "worldlist" name and some random numbers to not 
crush the file before.
also the program work on windows and linux, only this two operation system, sorry for rest maybe i update it later

how i run algora ?
-----------------
so, to run algora program, firstly you need python language installed on your operation system (read install python)
open command prompt (CMD) and write this line bofore start the program :
		-pip install termcolor
		-pip install pyfiglet
		-pip installdatetime     (maybe you find module alredy installed anyway it's okey
then if you work on windows type on command prompt : "py algora.py" or maybe type "python algora.py" and tape enter, if you find some difficult
type py and slide the file to command prompt
and if you work under Linux system, open terminal and write this line :
		-sudo apt-get install -y python-termcolor
		-sudo apt-get install -y python-pyfiglet
		-sudo apt-get install -y python-datetime    (maybe installed)
then type on terminal : python3 algora.py
	
	
what "algora" use for ?
-----------------------
i dont really care, you can use him anywhere you want lol, but it's really helpful for brute-force cracking by loopig
into many numbers to unlock crypte
like : wirless pin


how i install python?
---------------------
on windows:
to easy just go website https://www.pyhton.org/, after go download button and click on it, download the file 
and install it by clicking next until the end.
configure pyhton to path by clicking on control panel / system ans security / system / advenced system settings
a windows popup on advanced / envirenment variable / system variable / click path and copy the link to your python folder / then ok 
to test if its instaled enter command prompt and type : python
on linux:
you can check if python already instaled by open terminal and type : python --version, if its instaled on your system a message show (python 3.5.2)
3.5.2 it's the version of intsalled python on system you need to update it, but if is'nt installed you type (pkg install python3)
other way to install python3 on linux :
visite https://www.pyhton.org/ and download python 3.7 version linux, after downloading the file go terminal and type :
